            <div class="cat__description">Native to the Greek islands known as the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, these are
                natural cats, meaning they developed without humans getting involved in their breeding. As a breed,
                Aegean Cats are rare, although they are numerous on their home islands. They are generally friendly
                toward people and can be excellent cats for families with children.</div>
